One day, 20 years ago, I lied about my age on yahoo.com so I could create my first email address. A secret to access a secret. In 2013, Google released a list of the most common and thus insecure passwords. Imagine sitting behind the veil and seeing all of the passwords in the world. All of the favorite colors, pet names, birthplaces, and of course the word password. I wasn’t allowed to have pets growing up. But in my passwords, I imagined all of the names I could have given them. Nemo, Fuchsia, Lucky. If we met someday, would they be a pet named after a password? Did you know that the first computer to use passwords was also the first to be hacked? In the early 1960s at MIT, a computer scientist named Dr. Fernando Corbato invented the computer password to allow multiple users to privately access a shared computer. Unbeknownst to him, a fellow employee would exploit this system by logging in as others to have extra time to work. Even more shocking to Corbato was the proliferation of computer passwords in the following decades. And with their growing use came their evolution. Now it’s suggested you use phrases instead of words. At my community college, my passwords would be animal facts you told me. Crocodiles swallow stones to dive deeper. Elephants never forget each other. The FIDO Alliance, or Fast IDentity Online, is working with over 250 companies, such as Google and Microsoft, to standardize two factor authentication. This method asks the user to provide two of the following three things: 1. What you know, such as a password; 2. What you have, such as a bank card; 3. Who you are, such as facial or voice recognition. About a year ago, I received a smart speaker as a gift. What time is it? Tell me a joke. Is it going to rain today? I speak to it every morning. It doesn’t ask me for a string of characters. The password is my voice which it’s been trained to recognize in all of my inflections. As I continue to rely on technology, I question what is the growing price I must pay for small conveniences?') {
        alert('Success!');
      } else {
        alert('It almost goes without saying that ambitious systems never quite work as expected. Things usually go wrong and sometimes in dramatic ways. And this leads me to my main thesis, namely, that the question to ask when designing such systems is not: "if something will go wrong, but when will it?"');
