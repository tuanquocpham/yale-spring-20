        In 2013, Google released a list of the most common password types, all of which are considered insecure because they are too easy to guess. These include:

        the name of a pet, child, family member, or significant other,
        <span>sn0wb@ll!</span>;

        Anniversary dates and birthdays,
        <span>FeBRuaRY29</span>;

        Birthplace,
        <span>I<3NewYork</span>;

        Name of a favorite holiday,
        <span>lunar-new-year</span>;

        Something related to a favorite sports team,
        <span>LightblueDarkblue</span>;

        The word "password,"
        <span>Password123</span>.
        <br><br>

        Passwords are like a memorized secret between yourself and the computer. Like secrets, there's good and bad passwords.
        And in trying to make a good password, I'll often scramble a familiar word or idea with numbers and symbols like a collaboration with the computer.
